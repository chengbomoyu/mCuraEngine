/*!
 * Path order optimization class.
 * 
 * Utility class for optimizing the order in which things are printed, by
 * minimizing the distance traveled between different items to be printed. For
 * each item to be printed, it also chooses a starting point as to where on the
 * polygon or polyline to start printing, and determines which direction to
 * print in.
 *
 * To use this class, first create an instance and provide some parameters as
 * metadata. Then add polygons and polylines to the class. Then call the
 * \ref optimize function to compute the optimization. Finally, print the
 * polygons and polylines in the \ref paths field in the order in which they are
 * given.
 *
 * In the output of this class, polylines and polygons are combined into a
 * single vector: \ref paths . Each path contains a pointer to the original
 * polygon data, as well as whether that data represented a polygon or a
 * polyline, which direction to print that path in, and where to start along the
 * path.
 *
 * The optimizer will always start a polyline from either end, never halfway.
 * The Z seam is not used for these.
 * \tparam PathType The type of paths that will be optimized by this optimizer.
 * Make sure that a specialization is available for \ref get_vertex and
 * \ref get_size in order for the optimizer to know how to read information from
 * your path.
